# Disclaimer

Hello,

Before you review the code, I would like to share a brief disclaimer.

I am aware that the component architecture could be further refined. In a professional environment, I would typically split the UI into more reusable components and pass data through props (for example: buttons, award cards, FAQ items, etc.).

As I do not yet have extensive day-to-day experience with this level of component abstraction, and in order to meet the deadline of this exercise, I chose a more direct and partially hard-coded approach. This allowed me to deliver a functional application that meets the requirements of the assignment within the given timeframe.

This was a pragmatic choice made specifically for this test. I am fully aware of the possible improvements and confident that I could evolve this codebase toward a more modular and scalable architecture in a longer-term project.

Thank you for your understanding.
